# Hotel-Booking-Cancellation-Prediction
The objective of this project was to utilize machine learning techniques and data-driven solutions to minimize cancelations for hotels situated in cities and resorts, while maximizing revenue and profits. Cancelations result in revenue loss for hotels when they are unable to resell a room or have to incur additional costs to promote and sell the room at a discounted price during the last minute. By predicting which bookings are likely to be canceled and taking preventive measures, hotels can minimize the losses incurred after a booking is canceled.

The project involved data cleaning and exploratory data analysis using the tidyverse package to identify the best features affecting the target variable. Linear regression models were developed to predict the factors influencing the average daily revenue generated by a hotel. Additionally, classification models were created using support vector machine and logistic regression algorithm to identify the factors that contribute to a booking being canceled. Association rules mining was performed to determine the specific bookings that are more likely to be canceled by the customer.

Based on the initial analysis and machine learning models, the project provided business recommendations to reduce cancelation rates and increase profits for the hotels.
