# Hotel-Booking-Cancellation-Prediction

# Description
The objective of this project is to analyze hotel reservation data collected from customers all over the world to understand the key factors that cause customers to cancel their reservations. By utilizing statistical techniques and machine learning algorithms, we aim to provide actionable insights to reduce the rate of cancellations and improve revenue and profits for hotels.

# Project Scope and Objective
The scope of this project is to analyze a dataset containing 40061 hotel reservation records with 20 variables. Our objective is to identify the key attributes that mostly affect customers to cancel their hotel reservations and provide actionable insights to reduce the cancellation rates.

# Project Deliverables
Data preprocessing to clean the dataset and remove missing or invalid fields
Identification of key factors using Support Vector Machine and Random Forest algorithms
Using Apriori algorithm to suggest rules that can be used to reduce the number of hotel cancellations
Formulation of actionable insights after applying Support Vector Machine and Random Forest
Providing suggestions based on the data analysis to reduce the rate of cancellations

# Data Acquisition
The dataset provided contains 40061 hotel reservation records with 20 fields such as IsCanceled, LeadTime, StaysInWeekendNights, StaysInWeekNights, Adults, Children, Babies, etc. The data was extensively studied to determine key variables and then preprocessed to remove errors and make it usable for analysis.

By analyzing this dataset and drawing insights, we aim to provide valuable recommendations to hotels on how to reduce cancellation rates and increase revenue and profits.
